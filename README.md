Adds letters from the Gaj's Alphabet to selected text

How it works:
```
  'Zh' -> 'Ž'
  'zh' -> 'ž'
  'Sh' -> 'Š'
  'sh' -> 'š'
  'Ch' -> 'Č'
  'ch' -> 'č'
  'Cj' -> 'Ć'
  'cj' -> 'ć'
  'Dj' -> 'Đ'
  'dj' -> 'đ'
```

NOTE: This script will modify your clipboard since what it does is cut the selected text, add the letters and then paste it back
